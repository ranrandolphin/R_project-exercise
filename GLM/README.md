Write an R function that takes as parameters a matrix X and a vector Y and returns the vector of least
squares estimates, the fitted values and the residuals.

Write an R function that takes as parameters a vector of means $\mu$ a covariane matrix $S$ and a number $m$ and generates a sample of size m from the multivariate normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and covariance $S$. Plot the observations for 2 different bivariate normals (show both plots) with your choice of means $\mu$ and covariances $S$.

In ANOVA and F-test, Plot the power of the F-test as a function of $c/\sigma$ for 4 differents values of $n$ = 5, 10, 15, 100
For one of the values of $n$ above verify the finding by a simulation
